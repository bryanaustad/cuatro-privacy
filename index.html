    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Cuatro does not directly collect or store any personal data from its users. We do not ask for, access, or store any details such as your name, email address, or location. The app does not require any login or registration, and there is no personal user information stored on our servers.</p>
    <p>However, Cuatro integrates with third-party advertising services, specifically Google AdMob, which may collect certain information as described below.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Cuatro uses Google AdMob to serve advertisements in the app. Google AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide non-personalized ads. These ads are targeted based on contextual information, such as the content of the app, rather than user behavior or profile.</p>
    
    <p>Data collected by Google AdMob may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Such as device type, operating system, and app usage data.</li>
        <li><strong>General Location Information:</strong> Non-specific location data (e.g., country or city-level) may be used to ensure ads comply with local regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have configured Google AdMob to serve only non-personalized ads in compliance with guidelines for apps targeted at children and/or the general audience. This means no behavioral tracking or targeted advertising based on user activity or interests is used.</p>
    <p>For more details on Google AdMobâ€™s data practices, please review their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Advertising Practices and Human Review</h2>
    <p>To ensure compliance with child-appropriate advertising guidelines, Cuatro follows strict ad policies, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying only non-personalized ads that do not track user behavior.</li>
        <li>Utilizing Google AdMobâ€™s content filtering to restrict inappropriate ad content.</li>
        <li>Human review of ad creatives to ensure they are age-appropriate and comply with app store policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This review process helps minimize the risk of inappropriate ads being displayed to users.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>As the app itself does not collect or store personal information, any data usage related to ads is managed entirely by Google AdMob. Cuatro does not have access to or store any of this data.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Cuatro adheres to the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Appleâ€™s guidelines for apps in the Kids Category. Ads displayed in the app are designed to be appropriate for children. No personalized ads or data tracking occur within the app.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since Cuatro does not collect or store any user data, we do not implement specific security measures related to user information. However, we take general security measures to ensure the app functions correctly and securely.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted here, and we encourage users to review this page periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
